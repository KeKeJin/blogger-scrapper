Shadow is part Black Lab and part Golden Retriever. She also has some Rottweiler and German Shepherd in her, but overall she is 100\% Love Sponge. There are Pros and Cons to owning a black dog. The Cons: 1. You can't see her at night except for her eyes.2. She doesn't photograph well.3. Black dogs and white carpets don't mix. The Pros:     The Pros outweigh the Cons. "God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good." Genesis 1:31  \newline%
